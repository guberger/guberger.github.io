# Some current research projects

## Data-driven analysis and control of cyber-physical systems

I consider several problems related to the analysis and control of cyber-physical systems from data.
This is relevant in many applications where we do not have an accurate model of the system.
To address this, I study the synthesis of safety certificates (such as Lyapunov functions and barrier functions) and safe controllers (such as feedback controller and MPC) from data with probabilistic guarantees of correctness.

## Formal verification of cyber-physical systems

I consider the problem of certifying the safety and correctness of nonlinear and hybrid systems, which is crucial for safety-critical applications (such as medical devices and autonomous vehicles).
For that, I leverage powerful tools from optimization, computer science, and machine learning, such as sum-of-squares optimization, counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CeGIS), neural networks, and SMT solvers.

## Identification of cyber-physical systems

I address the problem of learning models for cyber-physical systems.
This is known to be a very challenging computational problem, but very important as many cyber-physical systems used in important applications are difficult to model from first principles (e.g., energy grids or biological systems).
