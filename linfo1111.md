# Main themes

The course focuses on
* understanding of mathematical tools and techniques based on a rigorous learning of concepts favored by highlighting their practical application,
* careful handling of these tools and techniques in the framework of applications.
For most concepts, applications are selected from the other courses of the computer science program (e.g., economy).
 
## Sets and Numbers

* Sets (intersection, union, difference)
* Order and equivalence
* Interval, upper bounds, lower bounds, extremes
* Absolute value, powers, roots

## Real functions of one variable

* Injective, surjective, bijective functions
* Algebraic operations on functions (including graphic interpretation)
* First-order functions
* Exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric functions
* Composition of functions and inverse functions

## Limits

* Conditions to ensure that a limit exists
* Cimits to infinity

## Continuous functions

* Fundamental theorems of continuous functions

## Differentiable functions
 
* Derivative at a point (including graphical interpretation)
* The Hospital's theorem
* Linear approximation of a function
* Maximum and minimum
* Increasing and decreasing function (sign study)
* Concavity and convexity
* Taylor's development

## Integrals

* Primitive
* Definite integrals (including graphic interpretation)
* Indefinite integrals

## Functions of two variables

* Notion and calculation of partial derivative
* Graphical interpretation of the gradient
* Interpretation and computation of the Hessian matrix 
* Intuitive introduction to the use of the Hessian matrix and gradient for a two-variable function to determine critical points and their nature
* Concept and computation of double integrals
For this last part, a mainly "tool" approach will be favored.
