# Problem sets

Problem sets will be given to you as problems that you will need to solve. These could be conceptual problems that ask you to work through some detail of a proof or formulate an optimization problem, but it could also be practical problems accompanied by a programming component. For instance, we could ask you to formulate a portfolio optimization problem to invest in a set of stocks. You may be asked to formulate the problem, describe the solution, and we may give you a dataset and ask you to implement your solution over the given dataset. 

Organization: Assignments and deadlines will be posted on canvas.

To be flexible, we will omit one problem set with the lowest scores from consideration while computing the overall grade.

# Programming

The course includes a important component of programming. We will do demonstrations of optimization programs during the class, and assignments will involve implementing small pieces of code to solve practical problems.

We recommend the use of Julia or Python.

# Course work and grades

The course work will consist in (a) problem sets (see above); (b) spot exams; and (c) final project.

## Problem sets (50% of the grade)

We expect to post 6 problem sets.

## Spot exams (25% of the grade)

We will have 2 spot exams spread out through the semester. They will test material that you have learned and go on for one hour each.

The first spot exam will take place on Wednesday March 15, 2023.

The second spot exam will take place on Wednesday May 3, 2023.

The questions will be theory and application of tools seen in the class. They will be written exams. The duration is 1 hour for each. Bring sheets of paper and writing material. They will take place in person in the usual classroom ECCS 1B28. If for some major reason you cannot attend in person, let me know as soon as possible.

## Final project (25% of the grade)

It will involve working in teams of two students who will understand a topic related to Linear, Integer, or Convex Optimization. The topic can be theory, algorithms and/or applications, as long as it goes beyond what has been covered in class.

The project will be presented in a 15-minute presentation during the last classes of the semester.

## Final Grades

Final grades will be calculated using the cumulative scores with the appropriate weights.
