# About

<!-- \tableofcontents you can use \toc as well -->

I am an FNRS Postdoctoral Researcher at UCLouvain, since October 2023.
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder.
I obtained my PhD in the study of Cyber-Physical Systems from UCLouvain, supervised by RaphaÃ«l Jungers, in 2021.
I obtained my Master Degree in Mathematical Engineering from UCLouvain in 2017.

# Research interests

My area of research is the analysis, control, and optimization of complex systems, like cyber-physical systems and hybrid systems.
I am particularly interested in formal verification and data-driven analysis of these systems, using tools from optimization, computer science and machine learning.
